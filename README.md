# Sphere Sandbox

Sphere Sandbox is a simple physics engine implemented in C++ using the SFML library. It allows you to simulate and interact with gravity in a 2D environment, demonstrating basic physics principles like collision detection and resolution.

## Features

- **Sphere Simulation**: Simulate multiple spheres with properties such as position, velocity, and acceleration.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between spheres and with boundaries.
- **Collision Resolution**: Resolve collisions using basic physics principles like conservation of momentum and energy.
- **SFML Integration**: Utilizes SFML for rendering graphics and handling user input.
- **Interactive Environment**: Interact with the spheres by adding new ones or adjusting their properties dynamically.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler that supports C++11 (e.g., GCC, Clang)
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pguin-sudo/ss.git
   cd ss
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   Use files in ss.zip;

   Or build project with Visual Studio into "x64/Release"

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   Run ss.exe

2. **Controls:**

   - **Horizontal arrows**: Increasing and decreasing balls' amortization;
   - **Vertical arrows**: Increasing and decreasing gravity;
